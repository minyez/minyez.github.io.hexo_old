## Introduction

I'm currently a Ph.D candidate at [College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering](http://www.chem.pku.edu.cn/en/) (CCME), [Peking University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_University) (PKU).

My research topics focus on developing electronic structure methods beyond density functional theory (DFT).

My mother tongue is Chinese. I also learned English and Japanese.

## Hobbies

I love reading literature, especially classics, although it's becoming harder for me to find enough patience to read.

I play basketball and used to play for the team of CCME graduate school. My favourite basketball player is [Steve Nash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Nash), a member of [Naismith Hall of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame). I also play softball with my friends, starting from the junior year during undergraduate.

Finally, [ACG](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACG) is the panacea. Those that I have been enjoy reading/watching:

- [Your Lie in April](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Lie_in_April) (ja: 四月は君の嘘 *shigatsu ha kimino uso*): a story of Kousei, a talented young pianist in his slump, his meet with Kaoru, a passionate violinist, and their vague but pathetic love. Both its anime and comic are excellent.
- [1/11](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/1/11_%E3%81%98%E3%82%85%E3%81%86%E3%81%84%E3%81%A1%E3%81%B6%E3%82%93%E3%81%AE%E3%81%84%E3%81%A1) (ja: じゅういちぶんのいち *juuichibunno ichi*): comics about the stories of the people in the life of Sora Anndou, a soccer player. There seems no official English and Chinese translation of this comic.
